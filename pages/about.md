# **About Me**
<br>
Hi its **{{ site.author.name }}**  :bowtie: :wave:, I am **Data Scientist**  :books: @ Tata Research and Development and Design Centre. :european_castle:<br><br>
Based out of TCS Innovations labs  :office: and being a part of a product based project, I have experienced and learned from the best of both worlds  :earth_asia:. While my research connection taught me how to identify and solve problems systematically, the product connection helped me understand and appreciate the business angle :moneybag:. Overall, I try to find the optimum between them  :triumph:

Have a look at my detailed  :scroll: [resume](../resume.pdf).

Or, just scroll :smile:
