# **About Me**
<br>

I have 5+ years of experience in solving business problems using Data Science techniques. I am an active AI/ML researcher with research papers on state-of-the-art deep learning-based solutions and active collaborations with several Universities. I was the winner of TCS SUPERCoder 2019 - a TCS wide coding competition. Finally, I have also written several technical articles on my website and Medium.

I have been part of two completely different and wild worlds - Research and Software Development.
